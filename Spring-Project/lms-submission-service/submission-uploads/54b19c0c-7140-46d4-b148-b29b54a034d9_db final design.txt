TOTAL TABLES: 6

(Optimal for 2-day project, not over-complex)

No	Table	Purpose
1️⃣	users	Teachers & students
2️⃣	groups	Student groups
3️⃣	group_members	Student–Group mapping
4️⃣	assignments	Assignment details
5️⃣	assignment_targets	Assignment visibility
6️⃣	submissions	Student submissions
1️⃣ USERS
users
- id (PK)
- username
- password
- role (TEACHER / STUDENT)

Relationships

One Teacher → many Assignments

One Student → many Submissions

2️⃣ GROUPS
groups
- id (PK)
- name
- created_by (FK → users.id)

Meaning

Groups are manually created by teachers

Represents batch / team / project group

3️⃣ GROUP_MEMBERS (Option B)
group_members
- group_id (FK → groups.id)
- student_id (FK → users.id)

Relationship

Many-to-Many

One group → many students

One student → many groups

✔ Clean
✔ Normalized
✔ Easy to explain

4️⃣ ASSIGNMENTS
assignments
- id (PK)
- title
- description
- assignment_type (FILE / LINK)
- instruction_path_or_link
- created_by (FK → users.id)
- created_at

Notes

FILE → instruction_path_or_link = file path

LINK → instruction_path_or_link = URL

5️⃣ ASSIGNMENT_TARGETS ⭐ (KEY TABLE)
assignment_targets
- id (PK)
- assignment_id (FK → assignments.id)
- target_type (ALL / GROUP / STUDENT)
- target_id (nullable)

How scope works
target_type	target_id	Meaning
ALL	NULL	Visible to all students
GROUP	group_id	Visible to students in that group
STUDENT	student_id	Visible to specific student

👉 One table replaces multiple mapping tables

6️⃣ SUBMISSIONS
submissions
- id (PK)
- assignment_id (FK → assignments.id)
- student_id (FK → users.id)
- submission_type (FILE / LINK)
- submission_content (file path or URL)
- submitted_at


✔ No marks
✔ No evaluation
✔ Only submission tracking

🧠 HOW TO EXPLAIN IN PRESENTATION (SCRIPT)

“Teachers create file or link-based assignments and define their visibility as all students, specific groups, or individual students. Groups are manually created and managed by teachers. Assignment visibility is handled using a unified assignment_targets table, keeping the design simple and scalable.”
