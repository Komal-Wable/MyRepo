## 🎤 **Script for Sprint 1 Presentation**

### 🧩 Slide 1: Title – *Overview of EdTech, Benchmark, Agile, Problem Solving, and Accessibility*

**Script:**

> Good morning everyone.
> I’m Komal Wable, and today I’ll be presenting an overview of five key areas we’ve focused on during Sprint 1 — **EdTech, Benchmark Universe, Agile methodology, Problem-Solving techniques, and Accessibility** in digital learning.
> Let’s begin with an introduction to EdTech.

---

### 💻 Slide 2: *Introduction to EdTech*

**Script:**

> EdTech stands for **Educational Technology**.
> It means using technology — like computers, apps, and the internet — to make teaching and learning easier, more interactive, and accessible to everyone.
> Examples include **Byju’s**, **Coursera**, and **Udemy**, which provide online learning platforms.
>
> The picture here shows a **digital classroom setup**, representing how modern education is moving online.
>
> In EdTech, certain **standards** are important to ensure everything works together smoothly. These include:
>
> * **SCORM** – ensures content works across different LMSs.
> * **xAPI (Experience API)** – tracks learning experiences.
> * **QTI** – for sharing and reusing test questions.
> * **LTI** – connects external tools like Quizlet or Zoom with LMSs.

---

### ⚙️ Slide 3: *SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model)*

**Script:**

> SCORM defines how online learning content and Learning Management Systems communicate.
> It helps content run properly no matter which LMS you use.
>
> For example:
>
> * In schools, teachers can share interactive lessons across systems.
> * For companies, it simplifies **new hire training**, making it trackable and reusable.
>
> The diagram here illustrates how SCORM acts as a bridge between **content** and **LMS platforms**.

---

### 📊 Slide 4: *xAPI (Experience API or Tin Can API)*

**Script:**

> xAPI is more advanced than SCORM. It can track learning activities **outside traditional LMS**, like mobile learning or simulations.
> It uses a database called **LRS – Learning Record Store** to store these records.
>
> The picture here shows the flow between learner activities and the LRS.
>
> xAPI tracks data in this format:
> **Actor – Verb – Object**
> Example: *“Komal completed Sprint 1 training.”*

---

### 🧩 Slide 5: *QTI & LTI Standards*

**Script:**

> **QTI (Question and Test Interoperability)** allows test questions and quizzes to be shared easily between platforms like Moodle and Blackboard.
> **LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability)** connects third-party tools — for example, you can embed Khan Academy or Zoom directly inside an LMS.
>
> The image here shows how LTI links different learning tools under one system, making the process seamless for teachers and learners.

---

### 🧠 Slide 6: *CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing)*

**Script:**

> CAT adjusts the difficulty of questions based on the student’s performance.
> For instance, if a student answers correctly, the next question is harder; if wrong, it becomes easier.
>
> This makes learning **personalized** and helps identify strengths and weaknesses quickly.
>
> The table in this slide summarizes how CAT creates personalized learning paths and efficient skill diagnosis.

---

### 🤖 Slide 7: *Adaptive Learning*

**Script:**

> Adaptive learning uses **AI and data analytics** to personalize learning materials for each student.
> Real-world examples include:
>
> * **Duolingo**, which adapts based on how well you know words or grammar.
> * **Khan Academy**, which adjusts exercises depending on your progress.
>
> The image shows a student-centered approach where content changes dynamically based on learner behavior.

---

### 📚 Slide 8: *Benchmark Universe Overview*

**Script:**

> Benchmark Universe is a **digital learning platform** widely used in schools.
> It offers **eBooks, interactive lessons, and assessments** — all designed to support personalized and engaging instruction.
>
> The image here represents different Benchmark Universe modules — showing Assessments, Assignments, Reporting, and Licensing.
>
> It supports **xAPI-based specifications like CMI5**, which improve tracking and reporting in LMSs.
> Also, Benchmark offers **BOC and PD** programs for professional development.

---

### 🧾 Slide 9: *Benchmark Universe Modules*

**Script:**

> Let’s look at its modules in detail:
>
> * **Assessments** – digital, auto-scored, and aligned with standards.
> * **Assignments** – teachers can schedule and customize learning tasks.
> * **Reporting** – real-time dashboards help track progress.
> * **Licensing** – offered through schools and integrated with LMSs using LTI.
>
> The table shown here compares each module and its function, giving a clear picture of Benchmark Universe’s structure.

---

### 👩‍🏫 Slide 10: *BOC & PD*

**Script:**

> **BOC** stands for *Back Office & Corporate*. It helps manage users, permissions, and compliance tasks.

Cloud bases erp central swt which integrate all data flowing to benchmark in different platform to integrate to form coreleted pic
> **PD** means *Professional Development*, which trains teachers to use new tools effectively.
>
> Together, they ensure smooth operations and ongoing teacher improvement.
>
> The diagram here highlights both — BOC on the administrative side and PD on the learning and training side.

---

### 🔄 Slide 11: *Agile and Scrum Framework*

**Script:**

> Now, moving to project management — we use the **Agile methodology**, which emphasizes flexibility and collaboration.
> Agile focuses on short cycles called **Sprints**, where teams build, test, and improve quickly.
>
> Within Agile, **Scrum** defines specific roles and events:
>
> * **Product Owner** – sets the vision and priorities.
> * **Scrum Master** – removes obstacles.
> * **Development Team** – builds the product.
>
> The table here shows the **Scrum events** like Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Review, and Retrospective — each helping continuous improvement.

---

### 🧩 Slide 12: *Problem Solving Techniques*

**Script:**

> Problem-solving is about finding the best solution efficiently.
> The main techniques we use are:
>
> * **Brainstorming** – generate ideas as a group.
> * **5W1H** – ask What, Why, When, Where, Who, and How.
> * **Root Cause Analysis** – identify the real reason behind a problem.
> * **Decision Tree** – visualize outcomes and choose the best path.
>
> The diagram in this slide visually represents how each method contributes to structured problem-solving.

---

### ♿ Slide 13: *Accessibility in EdTech*

**Script:**

> Accessibility ensures that everyone — including people with disabilities — can use digital learning platforms effectively.
>
> It follows the **WCAG standards** and **POUR principles**:
>
> * **P – Perceivable**
> * **O – Operable**
> * **U – Understandable**
> * **R – Robust**
>
> The icons in the picture show examples like screen readers, captions, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast themes.
>
> Making content accessible ensures **inclusive education for all** learners.

---

### 🙏 Slide 14: *Thank You Slide*

**Script:**

> That brings us to the end of the presentation.
> In this Sprint, we covered key EdTech standards, explored Benchmark Universe, understood Agile and Scrum, practiced structured problem solving, and ensured digital accessibility.
>
> Thank you for listening. I’m open to any questions or feedback.
