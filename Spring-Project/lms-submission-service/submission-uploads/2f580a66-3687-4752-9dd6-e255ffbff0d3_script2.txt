Opening
 
(Smile and make eye contact)
“Hello everyone!
My name is Komal Wable, and today I’m going to talk about a few interesting topics — EdTech, Agile, Problem Solving, and Accessibility.
 
These are all about how technology and teamwork can make learning smarter, faster, and easier for everyone.”
 
(Pause for a second)
“Let’s begin!”

Slide 1 – What is EdTech?
 
“First, let’s understand EdTech, which stands for Educational Technology.
 
In simple words, it means using technology — like computers, apps, and the internet — to make learning more effective and fun.
For example, online classes, learning apps like Byju’s or Coursera, and digital classrooms all come under EdTech.
 
It helps teachers teach better, and students learn in their own way, anytime and anywhere.”

Slide 2 – SCORM
 
“Next is SCORM.
You can think of SCORM as a rulebook for e-learning.
It helps online lessons and quizzes work properly on any platform.
 
So, if a company or school creates one training module, they can easily share it on different systems without rebuilding it.
It saves time and keeps everything organized.”

Slide 3 – xAPI
 
“Then comes xAPI, also called Experience API.
This one tracks what a learner does — not just in class, but anywhere.
 
For example, it can record when someone watches a video, completes a quiz, or even learns something on an app.
All this information goes into a database called the Learning Record Store.
 
This helps teachers and trainers understand each learner’s progress and give them more personalized lessons.”

Slide 4 – QTI and LTI
 
“Now, let’s talk about QTI and LTI.
 
QTI helps create and share question papers or tests easily between different learning systems.
So, if a quiz is made in one app, it can be used in another too.
 
LTI connects outside tools — like Zoom, Khan Academy, or Quizlet — directly into a learning platform.
It’s like plugging in extra tools that make learning more interactive and smooth.”

Slide 5 – CAT (Computerised adaptive testing)
 
“Next is CAT, which means Computer Assisted Teaching.
This simply means teachers use computers or digital tools to make lessons easier to understand.
 
For example, using videos, animations, or interactive slides in the classroom helps students stay interested.
It doesn’t replace teachers — it supports them in teaching better.”
 
 
---
 
Slide 6 – Adaptive Learning
 
“Now we have Adaptive Learning — one of my favorite topics!
This uses AI and data to change lessons based on how well each student is doing.
 
If a student finds something difficult, it gives more practice.
If they are doing well, it moves them to the next level.
So everyone learns at their own pace, which is amazing!”

Slide 7 – Benchmark Overview
 
“Next, let’s look at Benchmark Universe.
It’s a digital learning platform that helps both teachers and students.
 
Teachers can share eBooks, videos, and tests, and students can do their assignments online.
The platform also shows reports so teachers can see how each student is improving.
It’s really helpful for personalized and smart teaching.”

Slide 8 – Agile
 
“Now let’s move to Agile.
Agile is a way of managing projects in small, flexible steps.
Instead of finishing everything at once, teams work in short parts, get feedback, and keep improving.
 
It’s all about teamwork, communication, and learning from experience.”
 
 
---
 
Slide 9 – Scrum
 
“Scrum is part of Agile.
It breaks the work into short time periods called sprints.
 
Each sprint has planning, work, and a review at the end.
It helps the team stay organized, focused, and ready to adapt if something changes.”

Slide 10 – Problem Solving
 
“Now let’s talk about Problem Solving.
 
Problem solving is about understanding what the problem really is, thinking of ideas, and finding the best solution.
We can use different methods like:
 
Brainstorming — sharing ideas together,
 
Asking questions like What, Why, When, Where, Who, and How,
 
Finding the root cause, or
 
Drawing a decision tree to compare choices.
 
 
It’s a process of thinking smart and staying calm.”
 
 
---
 
Slide 11 – Accessibility
 
“And finally, Accessibility.
 
Accessibility means making sure that everyone — including people with disabilities — can use digital learning tools easily.
This includes things like captions for videos, screen readers for the blind, and keyboard navigation.
 
The main goal is to make learning open and comfortable for everyone.”

Closing
 
(Smile and pause slightly)
“So, to wrap up —
We learned how EdTech uses technology in education,
How Agile and Scrum help in teamwork,
How Problem Solving improves thinking,
And how Accessibility ensures everyone can learn.
 
Thank you so much for listening!
I hope you enjoyed and learned something new today.”
 
(Smile, nod, and end confidently)
